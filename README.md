# 👨‍💻 My DevOps Journey

Welcome to my personal DevOps learning journey! This repository is a space where I document my growth as I dive deep into the world of DevOps. From foundational knowledge to hands-on labs and projects, this repo will capture my progress step by step. Whether you're here to follow along or find inspiration for your own learning, I hope you enjoy the journey!

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository will evolve as I progress through various DevOps topics. Each topic gets its own folder, where I’ll organize notes, labs, and projects. Feel free to explore, and if you have any feedback or questions, I'd love to hear from you!

## 📁 Structure of My DevOps Repo

The directory structure will expand as I move forward. Here’s a sneak peek of what it may look like down the road:

```

## 🛠️ Modules

Each module represents a core pillar of DevOps knowledge that I’ll be exploring. Here's a breakdown of what I'll be covering:

- **Linux:** The bedrock of most DevOps tools. I'll be learning everything from basic commands to scripting.
- **Git & Version Control:** Git is critical for code collaboration. I’ll explore branching strategies, conflict resolution, and more.
- **Cloud (AWS):** Dive into cloud infrastructure management using AWS services like EC2, S3, and VPC.
- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):** Learn how to automate infrastructure deployments using Terraform.
- **Containers & Orchestration (Docker & Kubernetes):** Understand containerization and how to manage containers with Kubernetes.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Learn to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate the development process.
- **Networking:** Gain an understanding of how networks work and apply it to managing infrastructure.

## 📖 How I’m Using This Repository

This is my main learning hub. Here’s how I keep it organized and productive:

- **Regular Updates:** I commit frequently to keep track of my progress, insights, and solutions to any challenges I encounter.
- **Notes & Labs:** Each module has its own folder for notes, hands-on labs, and projects that will help solidify my learning.
- **Project-Based Learning:** I believe in learning by doing, so I’ll create mini-projects to apply the concepts I learn.
  
## 📌 Current Focus: 

I’m starting with the **Linux** and **Git** modules, covering the basics of shell scripting and version control. Expect to see lots of notes and small automation projects!

## ✍️ My Learning Philosophy

- **Hands-On First:** I learn best by doing. Every note or concept will be tied to a real-world lab or project.
- **Ask Questions:** I’ll reach out to the community and my mentors whenever I get stuck.
- **Document Everything:** Clear documentation will not only help me but anyone else who might reference this repo in the future.
