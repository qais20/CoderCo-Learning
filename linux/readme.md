# 🐧 Linux Module

Welcome to the **Linux** module of my DevOps learning journey! In this module, I'll dive into the foundational aspects of Linux, one of the most widely used operating systems in the DevOps ecosystem. This README provides an overview of Linux, its significance, and some essential commands that I’ll be using throughout my learning.

## 🌟 What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system based on UNIX. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it the preferred choice for servers, development environments, and cloud infrastructure. 

Linux provides a robust command-line interface (CLI), which allows users to interact directly with the system and automate tasks, making it an essential tool for system administrators, developers, and DevOps engineers.

## 🤔 Why is Linux Useful?

1. **Widely Used in DevOps:** Most cloud servers and DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins run on Linux.
2. **Security & Stability:** Linux is known for being highly secure and stable, which is why it’s the go-to operating system for servers.
3. **Open Source:** Linux is free and open-source, allowing developers to customize and optimize their environments as needed.
4. **Automation & Scripting:** Linux offers powerful tools for automating tasks through shell scripting, making it a key tool for DevOps and system administration.
5. **Networking & Server Management:** Linux is optimized for managing networks and servers, from small local setups to large-scale infrastructures.

## 🛠️ Common Linux Commands & Their Use Cases

Below is a list of essential Linux commands, their purposes, and use cases that I will regularly use throughout this module:

| **Command** | **Description** | **Use Case** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `pwd`       | Prints the current working directory. | Quickly see where you are in the file system. |
| `ls`        | Lists files and directories in the current directory. | View all files in a folder. Use options like `ls -la` for detailed info. |
| `cd`        | Changes the current directory. | Navigate between directories (e.g., `cd /home/user`). |
| `mkdir`     | Creates a new directory. | Create a new folder (e.g., `mkdir projects`). |
| `rm`        | Removes files or directories. | Delete a file (`rm file.txt`) or recursively remove directories (`rm -r folder/`). |
| `cp`        | Copies files or directories. | Copy files from one location to another (`cp file.txt /backup/`). |
| `mv`        | Moves or renames files or directories. | Rename or move files (`mv old.txt new.txt`). |
| `cat`       | Displays the content of a file. | Quickly view file contents (`cat notes.txt`). |
| `nano`      | Opens a text editor within the terminal. | Edit files in the terminal (`nano script.sh`). |
| `chmod`     | Changes file permissions. | Modify file permissions (e.g., make a script executable with `chmod +x script.sh`). |
| `ps`        | Displays currently running processes. | Monitor what processes are running on the system (`ps aux`). |
| `kill`      | Terminates a process. | Stop an unresponsive process by its process ID (e.g., `kill 1234`). |
| `top`       | Shows real-time system resource usage. | Monitor CPU and memory usage live. |
| `df`        | Shows disk usage of file systems. | Check available and used disk space (`df -h`). |
| `du`        | Estimates file and directory space usage. | Find out how much space a file or directory is using (`du -sh /var`). |
| `tar`       | Archives multiple files into a single tarball or extracts files from it. | Compress (`tar -czvf archive.tar.gz`) or extract (`tar -xvzf archive.tar.gz`) files. |
| `find`      | Searches for files in a directory hierarchy. | Locate files by name (`find / -name "file.txt"`). |
| `grep`      | Searches for patterns in files. | Search for specific text within a file (`grep "error" log.txt`). |
| `sudo`      | Runs a command with elevated (superuser) privileges. | Execute commands that require administrative access (`sudo apt-get update`). |
| `ssh`       | Securely connects to remote machines. | Remotely access another machine (e.g., `ssh user@server.com`). |
| `apt-get`   | Installs and manages software packages on Debian-based systems. | Install or update packages (`sudo apt-get install nginx`). |
| `systemctl` | Manages services (start, stop, restart). | Control system services like Apache, Nginx, or MySQL (`systemctl restart nginx`). |
| `history`   | Shows the list of previously executed commands. | Quickly recall previously run commands. |
| `echo`      | Prints a line of text. | Output text to the terminal or write to files (`echo "Hello" > hello.txt`). |
| `alias`     | Creates shortcuts for long commands. | Simplify frequent tasks (`alias ll='ls -la'`). |

## 💡 How I'm Applying Linux in DevOps

Linux skills are crucial for managing servers, deploying applications, and automating infrastructure. Some ways I’ll be applying Linux in my future DevOps projects include:

- **Automating System Tasks:** Using shell scripting to automate repetitive administrative tasks.
- **Cloud Server Management:** Most cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) use Linux as their default OS for virtual machines.
- **Containers:** Tools like Docker and Kubernetes heavily rely on Linux features, so understanding the OS is essential.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Linux commands and shell scripts are often integrated into CI/CD workflows to manage infrastructure and deployments.
