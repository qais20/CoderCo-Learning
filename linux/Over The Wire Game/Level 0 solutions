# Bandit Level 0: Connecting with SSH

## Level Objective
The goal for **Level 0** is to log into the Bandit game server via SSH using the following details:

- **Host**: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- **Port**: `2220`
- **Username**: `bandit0`
- **Password**: `bandit0`

Once successfully logged in, you can move on to solving the next level.

## Commands Required

- **`ssh`**: Secure Shell, a protocol to securely connect to remote systems.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Understanding the `ssh` Command
The **`ssh`** command is used to securely log into remote machines. The general syntax looks like this:

```bash
ssh username@hostname -p port
```

### Step 2: Applying the Bandit Level Details
For Bandit Level 0, we need to use:

- **Username**: `bandit0`
- **Host**: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- **Port**: `2220`

This leads to the following command:

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

### Step 3: Entering the Password
Once the command is executed, you will be prompted to enter the password. In this case, the password is provided as `bandit0`.

## Solution

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

After entering the password `bandit0` when prompted, you should successfully log into the server and be ready to tackle **Level 1**.

## Thought Process Behind the Solution

1. **Identifying the connection method**: Since the goal is to connect to a remote system, SSH is the ideal tool for this task.
2. **Understanding the SSH syntax**: Use the provided hostname, username, and non-standard port to establish a connection.
3. **Logging in**: After entering the password, the connection will be established, and the terminal session will allow you to interact with the server for the next level.
