The password for **Bandit Level 7** is located on the server and must meet all the following criteria:

- Owned by user: `bandit7`
- Owned by group: `bandit6`
- File size: 33 bytes

---

## üîß Commands You‚Äôll Need

- **`find`**: Search for files and directories.
- **`cat`**: Display the contents of a file.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Solution

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: Search for the File

Use the `find` command to search for a file that meets the specified criteria:

- **Owner**: `bandit7`
- **Group**: `bandit6`
- **Size**: 33 bytes

```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null
```

- `2> /dev/null` suppresses error messages about files you don‚Äôt have permission to access, keeping the output clean.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Display the Content of the Identified File

Once you have located the file (e.g., `/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`), use `cat` to read its contents:

```bash
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

This command will show you the password needed for the next level.
