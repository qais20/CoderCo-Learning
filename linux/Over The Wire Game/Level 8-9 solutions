## 🧑‍💻 Step-by-Step Solution

### 1️⃣ Step 1: List the Files

Ensure you’re in the correct directory and `data.txt` is present:

```bash
ls
```

### 2️⃣ Step 2: Display the Contents of the File

To check the content of `data.txt` and prepare for sorting:

```bash
cat data.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Step 3: Find the Unique Line

Use `sort` and `uniq` to identify the line that appears only once:

```bash
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
```

- `cat data.txt` outputs the file's content.
- `sort` arranges the lines, making it easier for `uniq` to find duplicates.
- `uniq -u` filters out lines that occur more than once, showing only the unique line.
