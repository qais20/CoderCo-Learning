## üßë‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Solution

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: List All Files (Including Hidden Files)
First, log into **Bandit3** and use the `ls -al` command to list all files in the current directory, including hidden ones.

```bash
ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls -al
```

You'll notice a directory named **inhere**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Navigate into the `inhere` Directory
Change to the **inhere** directory where the hidden file is located.

```bash
cd inhere
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: Identify the Hidden File
Use the `ls` command to list the files, and then `file ./-*` to identify which one contains ASCII text, which is likely the file containing the password.

```bash
ls
file ./*
```

The output will show the different file types, and you‚Äôll notice that **`-file07`** contains **ASCII text**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 4: Retrieve the Password
Use the `cat` command to display the content of the **`-file07`**, which contains the password for **Bandit4**.

```bash
cat ./-file07
```

## üîç Thought Process Behind the Solution

1. **Using `ls -a`**: This command ensures we can see hidden files.
2. **Identifying file types**: The `file` command helps differentiate between files that contain readable text and other data types.
3. **Correct file identification**: The password is usually in a file with **ASCII text**, making it the likely candidate.
4. **Retrieving the content**: Using `cat` allows us to read the file‚Äôs content directly, giving us the password.
